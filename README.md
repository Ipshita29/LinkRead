# MERN Blog Project (Client) 

This is the frontend client for the MERN Blog application, built using React and Vite. It provides the user interface for reading and interacting with blog posts.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application is a simple blog platform where users can view posts. This client-side application handles the presentation layer, fetching data from and potentially sending data to a backend API (built separately as part of the MERN stack).

This project utilizes the following technologies:

* **Frontend Library:** React 19
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Linting:** ESLint
* **Package Manager:** npm (implied from `package-lock.json`)

*(Note: The backend stack typically includes Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, but those are not part of this specific client repository.)*

## ‚ú® Features

* Minimal setup using Vite for fast development.
* React 19 for building the user interface.
